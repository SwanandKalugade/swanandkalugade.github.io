# Hello there! 👋🏼  
# I am a cross-disciplinary designer who dabbles with the code.  

Employed by Capgemini India, I am currently working as a design consultant for Terumo BCT USA account. For the past two years, I am building new medical device user interfaces/web applications for therapeutics and cell therapy divisions of Terumo BCT. 
Before that, I worked on designs of enterprise applications for Element fleet in Minnesota, CT Fluoroscopy controller for Cannon Medical Japan and facility design for RioTinto Australia.  

I like to collaborate with teams across geographies for a greater good. I am experienced in design to development handoffs in an agile framework.  

I stay current with the industry through online courses/expert articles/social media, to learn new skills and refine the ones I possess.  

**Things I can do**  
Full-stack design [research, design, prototype, solid HTML/CSS, little JS], craft interactions, creative coding, listen to music and play console games for entertainment.  

On this site, I have included only selected projects from my past work.  

Thank you for seeing me on the interweb. 🙏🏼
