# Namaste! I am Swanand Kalugade.  
# A cross-disciplinary designer who takes part in the code.  
I am currently working as a design consultant for *[Terumo Inc.](https://www.terumobct.com "Visit Terumo BCT website"){:target="_blank"}* in Colorado. For the past three years, I am building new medical GUI's / data management apps for Terumo's therapeutics and cell therapy divisions.  

Before that, I have contributed to design / development of enterprise apps for *[Element Fleet](https://www.elementfleet.com){:target="_blank"}* in MN, industrial design of CT Fluoroscopy controller for *[Cannon Medical](https://global.medical.canon/products/xray){:target="_blank"}* Japan¬†and design of processing excellence center for *[RioTinto](https://www.riotinto.com/about){:target="_blank"}* Australia.  

I like to collaborate with cross-functional teams and experienced in design to development handoffs in an agile framework. I stay current with the industry by following conferences whenever I can, but mostly through online courses, expert articles, and social media.  

**Things I can do**  
Full-stack design [research, design, prototype, test], craft front-end interactions, data visualization; discuss japanese stationary, studio ghibli films, and console games to heart's content.  

On this site, I have included only selected projects from my past work.  
Here is my *[resum√©](/assets/docs/Resume_SwanandKalugade_2020.pdf "Show Swanand's Resum√©"){:target="_blank"}* for your reference.  

Thank you for seeing me on the interweb! üôèüèº
