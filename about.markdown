# Namaste! I am Swanand Kalugade.
# A cross-disciplinary designer who dabbles with the code.  
<br>
I am currently working as a design consultant for *[Terumo BCT](https://www.terumobct.com "Visit Terumo BCT website"){:target="_blank"}* in Colorado, USA. For the past three years, I am building new medical device user interfaces/web applications for their therapeutics and cell therapy divisions. 

Before that, I worked on designs of enterprise applications for Element fleet in Minnesota, CT Fluoroscopy controller for Cannon Medical Japan and facility design for RioTinto Australia.  

I like to collaborate with cross-functional teams and experienced in design to development handoffs in an agile framework.  

I stay current with the industry through online courses/expert articles/social media, to learn new skills and refine the ones I possess.  

**Things I can do**  
Full-stack design [research, design, prototype, test], craft front-end interactions, data visualization, creative coding, listen to good music and play/discuss video games to heart's content.  

On this site, I have included only selected projects from my past work.
