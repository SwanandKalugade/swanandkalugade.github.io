# Hello! I am Swanand Kalugade. 
<div style="margin-bottom: -0.8em;"></div>
# A cross-disciplinary designer who dabbles with the code.

I am working as a design consultant for *[Terumo Inc.](https://www.terumobct.com "Visit Terumo BCT website"){:target="_blank"}*, Colorado. As part of a diverse team spread across timezones, I am contributing to new medical device GUI's, and data management apps for their therapeutics and cell therapy divisions.

Prior to this, I was responsible for design / development of enterprise apps for *[Element Fleet](https://www.elementfleet.com){:target="_blank"}* in MN, industrial design of CT Fluoroscopy controller for *[Cannon Medical](https://global.medical.canon/products/xray){:target="_blank"}* Japan¬†and design of processing excellence center for *[RioTinto](https://www.riotinto.com/about){:target="_blank"}* Australia.

I like to collaborate with cross-functional teams and experienced in design to development handoffs in an agile framework. I have demonstrated delivery of innovative and practical designs while working under broad directives with minimal hand-hold or oversight.

I am proficient in product developement activities (research, design, prototype, test), and can also craft front-end interactions. Over weekends I get busy gardening, learning something, or enjoy my favorite video games.

On this site, I have included selected projects from my past work.

Here is my *[resum√©](/assets/docs/Resume_SwanandKalugade_2020.pdf "Show Swanand's Resum√©"){:target="_blank"}* for your reference.

Thank you for seeing me on the interweb! üôèüèº
