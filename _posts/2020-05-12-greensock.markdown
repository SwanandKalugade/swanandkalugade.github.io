Conveying interactions  in projects to remote development teams could sometimes be challenging. To overcome this challenge, I used After Effects to design the UI transitions. GSAP's TweenMax library assisted me to write those in code.   

I studied GSAP's TweenMax with Sara Dresner's Advanced SVG course on Front-End Masters. I used that knowledge in crafting following sequences.
