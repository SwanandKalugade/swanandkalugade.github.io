Conveying interactions  in projects to remote development teams could sometimes be challenging. To overcome this challenge, I used After Effects to design the UI transitions. GSAP's TweenMax library assisted me to write those in code.   

I studied GSAP's TweenMax with Sara Dresner's Advanced SVG course on *[FrontEndMasters](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/svg-essentials-animation/ "Open FrontEndMasters"){:target="_blank"}*. I used that knowledge in crafting following sequences.
