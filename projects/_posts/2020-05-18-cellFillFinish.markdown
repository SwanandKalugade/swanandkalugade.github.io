# Background
Cell therapy manufacturing is a complex, multi-step process that takes place at various locations. But in general, cell therapy labs show an overall low level of automation throughout all regions.

This device is the first device of its kind to automate the final steps of cell and gene therapy manufacturing process, while help facilitate cGMP compliance. It is a functionally closed system for cells that automates mixing, cooling, air removal, aliquoting and sealing.
